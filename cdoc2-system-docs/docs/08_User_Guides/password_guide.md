# Guide to Encrypting Files with a Strong Password

Encrypting files with a strong password adds an additional layer of protection, ensuring that only you can access your sensitive information. It also has the advantage of not requiring access to a key device or any EID service via internet. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to encrypt your files with a strong password:

**Step 1: Assess Password Strength Requirements**
Before encrypting your files, it's important to understand the password strength requirements. The minimum password criteria are as follows:

- Length: 18 - 50 characters
- Contains:
  - At least one digit (0-9)
  - At least one uppercase letter

**Step 2: Choose a Strong Password**

You have two options for selecting a strong password:

a) Use the auto-suggest feature to generate a random password. The password will have the following criteria:

- Length: 18 characters
- Contains:
  - At least one digit (0-9)
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - Exactly two hyphens "-"
  - Exactly 16 lowercase letters (a-z)

b) Manually create a password meeting the specified criteria. It is recommended to utilize a password manager to generate a strong, random password that meets the criteria and then store the password there.

**Step 3: Encrypt Your Files**

Once you have a strong password, proceed to encrypt your files. Follow these steps:

1. Select the file(s) you want to encrypt.
2. Right-click on the file(s) and choose the option to encrypt.
3. You will be prompted to enter a password. Input the strong password you've created.
4. Follow any additional on-screen instructions to complete the encryption process.

**Step 4: Safeguard Your Password**

Your encrypted files are now protected by a strong password. However, it's crucial to safeguard the password itself. Here are some tips:

- **Use a Password Manager**: If you used a password manager to generate the password, ensure the manager itself is secured with a strong master password.
- **Write down the Password**: Avoid storing the written password in easily accessible locations.
- **Never Share**: Never share your password with anyone unless absolutely necessary.

By following these steps, you can effectively encrypt your files with a strong password, enhancing the security of your electronically stored data and making it suitable for long-term storage.

## Guide to Storing an Encrypted File Container Long-Term

Encrypting sensitive files is a crucial step in safeguarding your data, but equally important is ensuring that the encrypted CDOC2 container is stored securely for the long term. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to store an encrypted container to maintain its integrity and accessibility over time:

**Step 1: Choose a Reliable Storage Medium**

Select a reliable storage medium that offers durability and longevity. Options include external hard drives, USB flash drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), or cloud storage services from reputable providers. Consider factors such as physical durability, data retention rates, and redundancy options.

**Step 2: Encrypt the Storage Medium (Optional)**

Before storing any data, encrypt the entire storage medium using robust encryption software or built-in encryption features provided by the operating system. This adds an additional layer of security to protect the contents of the storage device in case it falls into unauthorized hands.

**Step 3: Backup the Encrypted File Container**

Implement a robust backup strategy to prevent data loss in case of storage device failure, damage, or loss. Create redundant backups of the encrypted CDOC2 container on multiple storage devices or cloud storage services.

**Step 4: Document Storage Location and Access Details**

Keep detailed records of the storage location of the encrypted file container, including password or encryption keys. Store this documentation in a secure and easily accessible location, such as a password-protected document or a physical safe.

**Step 5: Periodically Verify Data Integrity**

Regularly verify the integrity of the encrypted file container and its contents to ensure that no corruption or unauthorized modifications have occurred. Use checksums or integrity verification tools provided by your encryption software to perform these checks.

**Step 6: Monitor Storage Conditions**

Monitor the storage conditions of the encrypted file container to prevent environmental factors such as extreme temperatures, humidity, or magnetic fields from damaging the storage medium. Store the device in a cool, dry, and stable environment away from direct sunlight and electromagnetic interference.

By following these steps, you can effectively store an encrypted file container for the long term, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of your sensitive data over time.
