# Guide to Encrypting Files with a Strong Password

Encrypting files with a strong password adds an additional layer of protection, ensuring that only you can access your sensitive information. It also has the advantage of not requiring access to a key device or any EID service via internet. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to encrypt your files with a strong password:

**Step 1: Assess Password Strength Requirements**
Before encrypting your files, it's important to understand the password strength requirements. The minimum password criteria are as follows:

- Length: 20 - 64 characters
- Contains:
  - At least one digit (0-9)
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter

**Step 2: Choose a Strong Password**

You have two options for selecting a strong password:

a) Use the auto-suggest feature to generate a random password. The password will have the following criteria:

- Length: 20 characters
- Contains:
  - At least one digit (0-9)
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)

b) Manually create a password meeting the specified criteria. It is recommended to utilize a password manager to generate a strong, random password that meets the criteria and then store the password there.

**Step 3: Encrypt Your Files**

Once you have a strong password, proceed to encrypt your files. Follow these steps:

1. Select the file(s) you want to encrypt.
2. Right-click on the file(s) and choose the option to encrypt.
3. You will be prompted to enter a password. Input the strong password you've created.
4. Follow any additional on-screen instructions to complete the encryption process.

**Step 4: Safeguard Your Password**

Your encrypted files are now protected by a strong password. However, it's crucial to safeguard the password itself. Here are some tips:

- **Use a Password Manager**: If you used a password manager to generate the password, ensure the manager itself is secured with a strong master password.
- **Write down the Password**: Avoid storing the written password in easily accessible locations.
- **Never Share**: Never share your password with anyone unless absolutely necessary.

By following these steps, you can effectively encrypt your files with a strong password, enhancing the security of your electronically stored data and making it suitable for long-term storage.
