[#RM-55937](https://rm-int.cyber.ee/ito/issues/55937): CDOC2 minimal implementation for encrypting/decrypting [CDOC2 with Smart-ID](SID_minimal.md)

~~Considered solution for implementing [CDOC2 Smart-ID/Mobiili-ID](cdoc2_tara.md) using TARA. 
Scrapped, because JWT tokens are signed by TARA, not authentication device. Also adds dependcy for TARA~~
